# BraggingRights
BraggingRights is an application leveraging the capabilities of the Tweepy Twitter API library and the Google NLP API to allow users to get ranked lists of Twitter handles. 

## Overview
Although it may only be played in the fall, for real fans, college football is a year-round topic of conversation. So why should bragging rights be limited to just during the season? And moreover, shouldn’t we be able to brag not only about how our team is performing on the field, but also about the strength of our fanbase and the support of our coaches?

BraggingRights provides a mean to settle the important questions which pervade the incessant debates of college football fans. Which fanbase supports their team the most? Which coach is on the hot seat? Using the unmatched reach of Twitter and the power sentiment analysis tools of the Google Natural Language Process API, Bragging Rights gives you the real-time insight you need to prove just how strong your team’s program really is.

But what if you’re not into college football? We get it. BraggingRights also lets users retrieve custom Rankings by taking in a list of user-supplied Twiter handles and producing a definitive ranking of the results (from most positive to least) based on the sentiment of the tweets tagging this handle. Whatever the motivations behind your ranking, BraggingRights has your answers.
